# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## The Definitive 2025 Practitioner's Book

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, as well as professional engineers who already know Python and basic machine learning but are new to robotics.

### About This Book

This book is organized into four comprehensive modules that progressively build your understanding of embodied intelligence:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System** - Covers ROS 2 fundamentals and AI integration
- **Module 2: Digital Twin & Simulation** - Focuses on simulation and digital twin technologies  
- **Module 3: AI-Robot Brain** - Explores high-level AI integration with robot control
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Integration** - Combines perception, cognition, and action in VLA systems

### What You'll Learn

Through this book and its accompanying examples, you will:
- Master ROS 2 concepts including nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Integrate AI models with robotic systems using rclpy
- Model humanoid robots using URDF and Xacro
- Build complete ROS 2 packages for humanoid control
- Understand the principles of embodied intelligence
- Implement safety and performance considerations for AI-robot systems
- Create responsive, low-latency AI-robot communication systems

### Technical Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 operating system
- ROS 2 Iron (December 2025 version)
- Python 3.11
- At least 8GB RAM for simulation components
- Compatible GPU for Gazebo simulation

### The "Athena" Humanoid Model

Throughout this book, we use the "athena" humanoid robot model - a 23-DoF simplified Unitree G1 / generic biped that serves as our consistent example for all implementations and exercises.

### Getting Started

If you're ready to dive in, start with [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System](./module1/intro.md), where we'll explore the fundamental differences between digital AI and embodied intelligence.
