### Instructions:
1. Combine VLA, speech, and hardware abstraction layers
2. Implement the complete voice-to-action pipeline
3. Add safety and monitoring systems
4. Test the integrated system end-to-end

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 2: Complex Task Planning
Implement a task planner that decomposes complex commands into execution sequences.

### Instructions:
1. Parse complex natural language commands
2. Decompose into simpler subtasks
3. Plan execution sequence and dependencies
4. Execute multi-step tasks successfully

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 3: Performance Optimization
Optimize the complete system for real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware.

### Instructions:
1. Profile system performance bottlenecks
2. Optimize model inference with quantization
3. Implement action prediction caching
4. Measure and improve latency/throughput

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 4: Athena System Evaluation
Evaluate the complete Athena system on the 12 specified natural language commands.

### Instructions:
1. Define 12 representative natural language commands
2. Execute each command on the Athena system
3. Measure success rate and execution quality
4. Document performance across different hardware tiers

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
