# Chapter 17 Exercises: Language Grounding in VLA Models

## Exercise 1: Language Model Integration
Integrate a large language model with the VLA system to condition actions based on complex text instructions.

### Instructions:
1. Load a language model (e.g., Llama 3.1 8B)
2. Process text instructions with the language model
3. Generate embeddings that can condition the VLA model
4. Test with various natural language commands

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 2: Text Embedding Fusion
Implement the fusion of text embeddings with visual features for language-conditioned action generation.

### Instructions:
1. Extract visual features from an image
2. Generate text embeddings from an instruction
3. Implement fusion mechanism (concatenation, attention, etc.)
4. Test how language affects action generation

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 3: Prompt Engineering
Experiment with different prompt formats to optimize language-to-action mapping.

### Instructions:
1. Try various prompt templates
2. Test how prompt structure affects VLA output
3. Optimize for specific manipulation tasks
4. Document which formats work best

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 4: Multimodal Alignment
Evaluate how well the language and vision components align in the VLA model.

### Instructions:
1. Test the model with matching and mismatching text-image pairs
2. Analyze attention weights between modalities
3. Document alignment quality metrics
4. Suggest improvements for better alignment

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
