# Chapter 16 Exercises: OpenVLA Fundamentals

## Exercise 1: Basic VLA Inference
Implement a simple script that loads the OpenVLA model and runs inference on a sample image with a basic instruction.

### Instructions:
1. Load the OpenVLA model
2. Load a sample image
3. Provide a simple instruction like "Pick up the red object"
4. Run inference and observe the output

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 2: Action Space Exploration
Explore the action space of the VLA model by running inference with different instructions on the same image.

### Instructions:
1. Use the same image for multiple inferences
2. Try different instructions like "move left", "move right", "grasp object"
3. Record and analyze the differences in the output action vectors

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 3: Image Preprocessing
Implement image preprocessing steps that match the training data preprocessing for the VLA model.

### Instructions:
1. Apply necessary normalization
2. Resize images to the expected input dimensions
3. Convert to appropriate tensor format
4. Test with a few sample images

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 4: Performance Evaluation
Evaluate the inference performance of the VLA model in terms of latency and throughput.

### Instructions:
1. Time the inference process
2. Measure latency for single and batched inferences
3. Test with different model precisions (float16 vs int8)
4. Document performance metrics

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
