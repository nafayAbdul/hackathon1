# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Models – From Voice to Physical Action

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models - systems that can understand natural language commands, perceive their environment visually, and execute appropriate physical actions.

In this module, you will learn to build cognitive robots that respond to human speech by performing complex physical tasks. The culmination of your learning will be the "Athena" system - a complete voice-commandable humanoid system that operates in real environments.

## Module Overview

This module consists of five chapters:

1. **Chapter 16: OpenVLA Fundamentals** - Understanding vision-based action generation
2. **Chapter 17: Language Grounding in VLA Models** - Integrating text understanding with action
3. **Chapter 18: Voice-to-Action Pipeline** - Converting speech to physical actions
4. **Chapter 19: Real-World Deployment** - Safe operation in unstructured environments
5. **Chapter 20: Capstone Integration** - Complete Athena autonomous system

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Module 2: Simulation Integration (Isaac Sim and digital twins)
- Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac Platform)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement Vision-Language-Action models for robotic manipulation
- Integrate speech recognition with robotic action planning
- Deploy cognitive systems safely in real-world environments
- Build the complete Athena system capable of responding to natural language commands
