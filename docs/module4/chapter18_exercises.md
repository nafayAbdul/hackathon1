# Chapter 18 Exercises: Voice-to-Action Pipeline

## Exercise 1: Speech Recognition Integration
Integrate Whisper with the VLA system to convert speech commands to text.

### Instructions:
1. Set up Whisper for speech-to-text conversion
2. Process audio files to get transcriptions
3. Pass transcriptions to the VLA system
4. Test with various voice commands

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 2: Real-Time Voice Processing
Implement a real-time voice processing pipeline for continuous command recognition.

### Instructions:
1. Set up audio streaming from microphone
2. Process audio in real-time chunks
3. Convert speech to text using streaming Whisper
4. Feed commands to VLA system with low latency

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 3: Voice Activity Detection
Add voice activity detection to distinguish between commands and background noise.

### Instructions:
1. Implement voice activity detection
2. Only process audio when speech is detected
3. Filter out background noise and false triggers
4. Test in noisy environments

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
```

## Exercise 4: Multilingual Voice Commands
Extend the system to support voice commands in multiple languages.

### Instructions:
1. Implement language detection for incoming audio
2. Use appropriate ASR model for the detected language
3. Process commands in different languages
4. Test with voice commands in multiple languages

### Solution Code:
```python
# Solution would go here
