# Module 2: Simulation Integration – The Digital Twin (Weeks 6–8)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on creating digital twins of robotic systems through advanced simulation techniques. You'll learn to master physics engines, implement realistic sensors, create photorealistic rendering, and generate synthetic datasets for AI training.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Choose and configure the appropriate physics engine for your robotic application
2. Simulate realistic sensors matching Tier 1-4 hardware specifications
3. Create photorealistic rendering for human-robot interaction studies
4. Generate large-scale synthetic datasets using domain randomization
5. Integrate navigation, manipulation, and speech recognition in a complete autonomous stack

## Module Structure

This module contains five comprehensive chapters designed to build your expertise progressively:

- **Chapter 6**: Simulation in 2025 – Choosing and Mastering Your Physics Engine
- **Chapter 7**: Realistic Sensors in Simulation – Depth, LiDAR, IMU, and Contact
- **Chapter 8**: Photorealistic Rendering with Unity and Unreal for Human-Robot Interaction
- **Chapter 9**: Domain Randomization and Large-Scale Synthetic Data Generation
- **Chapter 10**: Closing the Sim Loop – Full Autonomous Stack in the Digital Twin

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed Module 1 and have a working ROS 2 + URDF humanoid named "athena"
- Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Iron installed
- Basic understanding of Gazebo simulation (covered in Module 1)

## Technical Requirements

All examples in this module are tested with:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- ROS 2 Iron
- Gazebo Harmonic
- Python 3.8+
- Hardware: RTX 4070 Ti minimum (for optimal performance)

Let's begin by exploring the physics engine landscape in 2025 and mastering Gazebo Harmonic!
