# Chapter 17: Language Grounding in VLA Models – From Text to Action

This chapter builds on Chapter 16 by integrating language understanding with VLA models. Readers will learn to condition VLA models on text prompts to perform goal-directed manipulation tasks.

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate large language models with VLA systems
- Implement text embedding and fusion techniques
- Engineer effective prompts for VLA tasks
- Evaluate language-vision alignment

## Key Topics
- Large Language Model Integration
