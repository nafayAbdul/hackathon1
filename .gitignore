# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, if you have a direct dependency on the project, you might not wish to
#   include Pipfile.lock. Check for yourself.
Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   However, if you have a direct dependency on the project, you might not wish to
#   include poetry.lock. Check for yourself.
