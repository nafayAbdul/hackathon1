# Physical AI Docusaurus UI Theme

## User Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Assistant Response

I've successfully created the feature specification for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Docusaurus UI Theme. Here's a summary of what was completed:

1. **Branch Creation**: Created the branch `002-docusaurus-ui-theme` based on the existing pattern in the repository

2. **Specification File**: Created a comprehensive specification document at `specs/002-docusaurus-ui-theme/spec.md` that includes:
   - User scenarios and testing requirements with prioritized user stories
   - Functional requirements based on the provided feature description
   - Success criteria that are measurable and technology-agnostic

3. **Quality Checklist**: Created a validation checklist at `specs/002-docusaurus-ui-theme/checklists/requirements.md` to ensure the specification meets quality standards

The specification captures all the key requirements from the original feature description, including:
- Docusaurus-specific implementation constraints
- Design tokens and typography specifications
- Page structure mapping
- Animation and interaction rules
- Responsive behavior requirements
- JavaScript behavior requirements

The specification is now ready for the next phase (`/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`) as it has passed all quality validation criteria.
