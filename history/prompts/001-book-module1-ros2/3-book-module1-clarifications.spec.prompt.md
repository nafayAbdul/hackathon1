## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

All clarifications have been successfully integrated into the specification document. We've added 5 important clarifications to improve the book module specification:
1. Added latency target requirement for AI-robot communication (<100ms)
2. Included security best practices and SROS2 features
3. Added accessibility requirements for educational content
4. Specified error handling scenarios for network timeouts, sensor failures, and actuator errors
5. Added localization considerations for international audiences

The specification document has been updated with these clarifications in the "Clarifications" section, with corresponding updates to the "Success Criteria" and "Requirements" sections.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Enhanced specification with important non-functional requirements
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for specification update
- 📁 Files: 1 file updated (spec.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully clarified important aspects of the book module
