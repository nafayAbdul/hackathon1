Figure 1.1: Digital AI vs Physical AI comparison

Description: This diagram illustrates the key differences between digital AI systems (like ChatGPT) and physical AI systems (like humanoid robots).

Left side: Digital AI
- Represents a computer/monitor with text bubbles
- Shows clean, structured data flowing in
- Text labels: "Controlled Environment", "Predictable Inputs", "No Physical Consequences"

Right side: Physical AI
- Represents a humanoid robot
- Shows multiple sensor inputs (vision, touch, proprioception)
- Text labels: "Dynamic Environment", "Multiple Sensor Streams", "Real-time Constraints", "Physical Consequences"

Between the sides: A comparison arrow showing the contrast
