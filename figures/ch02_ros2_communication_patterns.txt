Figure 2.1: ROS 2 Communication Patterns

Description: This diagram illustrates the four main communication patterns in ROS 2: Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions.

Diagram components:
- Node icon: Rectangle representing a computational unit
- Topic icon: Unidirectional arrow with circular broadcast
- Service icon: Bidirectional arrow showing request/response
- Action icon: Bidirectional arrow with feedback loop

Visual representation of how these patterns interconnect in a robotic system.
